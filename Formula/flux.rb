  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      flux requires dvc — install it if you haven't already:
        pip install "dvc[s3]"

      Configure flux once per machine (stores credentials in macOS Keychain):
        flux config

      Then add flux to each Git repo you want to manage:
        cd your-repo && flux add
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "flux HEAD-", shell_output("#{bin}/flux version")
  end
end
